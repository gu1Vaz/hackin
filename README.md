# Hackin
**[code in branch master]**

A copy of github, but to save codes used in pen testing.

The project contain:
- Client developed in React
- Backend developed in AdonisJs(Framework NodeJs)
- Backend developed with Socket.io to work the chat

The idea is to be able to share pen test code with the community on a platform similar to github.

It's not online yet, but someday I'll host it on a server on the internet
